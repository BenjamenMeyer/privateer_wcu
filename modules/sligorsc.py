							("Sligor","Yes. We've had many investors in the past. Junction is the main traffic point for Gemini, as well as the most secure connection to Sol. We now want to show the investors that their expenditures have proven profitable."),
							("Burrows","Sounds to me like Junction isn't that safe at all."),
							("Sligor","Although we are quite removed from cat space, pirate--and especially Retro--activity is on the rise. We know virtually nothing concerning their purposes or even if we are a target.  We believe the Retro attacks are side-effects of their siege at Oxford."),
							("Burrows","And you want me to find out what's going on."),
							("Sligor","Exactly. Since we want to make Speke a major trade center, we can't afford sudden ambushes on our freighters. We know about the hidden pirate base in the Pentonville system. I want you to show the pirates that they had better not try to take a foothold in Junction. I need you to wipe out the pirates in Pentonville."),
							("Burrows","I'm not too sure if that would be so easy."),
							("Sligor","I didn't say it would be easy, but you would be doing me a favor, and we are not prepared to fight on two fronts at this time.  We can concentrate on the Retros after we slow down the pirates. I'll pay you 20000 credits for this.")],

Your strike should delay further pirate operations for weeks, which gives us time to concentrate on the Retros. We need to find out why so many armed forces are cruising through Junction."),

According to the disc you brought back, I need you to defend Junction from a Retro attack: several capital ships are planning to invade the system, and I don't know which planet they'll start with. I'll pay 20000 if you will defend their target. Since this is relatively new information, and since we haven't had time to do a comprehensive analysis, I can only give you one Gunship as escort.  We can't afford to gamble by sending our entire force.")],

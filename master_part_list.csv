"gothri","starships/Deprecated",2500000,132,2700,"<Ships/Report_Bug>The Kilrathi Gothri can pose a very real threat to any ship in the Gemini Sector.

One thing to keep in mind before catching up with your target is that the Dralthi's firepower is rather weak."

The Salthi bears the distinction of being the only class of spacecraft officially sanctioned by the reverend Jones, who, when presented with its initial designs just over a year ago, said that prayer had revealed to her that that this was to be the 'shepherds crook' by which man's sins would be constrained. Inexpensive, even at the time of its introduction, the Salthi remains a utilitarian craft well suited to the production schedules of backwater worlds."

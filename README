README FOR PRIVATEER REMAKE VERSION 1.2
***************************************
June 9th, 2005

Privateer 1.2 can be installed by downloading and running the full 1.2 install package, or by downloading and running the much smaller patch. The patch will update version 1.0 or later of Privateer Remake to the release version of Privateer Remake 1.2.

---------------------
Quickguide
---------------------
- Use the arrow keys to steer
- Press 'n' to target navigational points
- Press 'a' to automatically fly there
- Press 't' to target spaceships
- Press Spacebar to fire your guns at them
- Press tab to accelerate to full speed and turn on afterburners (if you have any)
- To land, fly into the base, or press 'd' on harder difficulties.
- Buy a Jump Drive in the misc category of the upgrade computer and use 'j' in a blue jump point to teleport to a different start
- Buy low and sell high.  For example, buy iron on a mining base and sell elsewhere

---------------------
What's new in 1.2?
---------------------
- Autotracking only operates on locked targets. Lock your target with 'l' if your radar supports it (generally only the highest two radars of a given brand support locking)
- "t" no longer targets everything. "t" only targets ships, and you must use "n" or the nav map to select destinations for navigation.
- Radar targetting cone limitations are implemented when playing on medium and hard difficulty. This means that you must turn your ship to place the target in front of you before you can use any of the targetting keys to select it. If a target flies outside of the cone, you may lose designation unless you have locked the target.
- Asteroids are destrictible, impart more collision damage, and in general behave a lot better than asteroids in 1.1. They also require more system resources, and in some systems the 1.0-style asteroids will be used for performance reasons, based on your config settings.
- Milspec ships are no longer available for purchase.
- Torpedo mounting capability per mount has been reduced from 20 to 10.
- 2D wireframe images have been added for all targetable objects.
- Enemy damage is now viewable in 4 separate quadrants.
- Radar ranges have been reduced.
- Jump bubbles do not absorb weapons fire.
- Clicking on the Centurion, Orion, or Galaxy in the ship dealer initiates a direct purchase of those ships and automatically sells your old ship and its upgrades. Multiple ships can be owned by purchasing ships through the upgrades screen. This is also the place to purchase ships that were not available for purchase in the original Privateer.
- Pressing "r" gives a damage report much more like the original Privateer.
- A white nav cross now appear on the HUD, marking your selected destination.
- "Scanning" MFD animation added for patrol missions.
- "Signal Lost" MFD animation added for when a ship is destroyed in the middle of a communication.
- You cannot dock with hostile capships.
- You can only match speed with cargo.
- Docking clamps do not appear when they are not required by the difficulty settings.

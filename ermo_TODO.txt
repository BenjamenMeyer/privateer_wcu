= Goals

The overarching goal is two-fold:

 1. Update PU to run on the newest VS on Linux

 2. Make PU a suitable base for Privateer: Wing Commander Universe


== 1. Update PU to run on the newest VS on Linux

Facts:
 * Sadly, we've lost access to the PU SVN history.
 * PU r505 does not work on Linux due to case-sensitivity issues
 * The PU assets are not all working (sprites reference missing assets)
 * The Windows support stuff is outdated
 * It is possible to solve all of the above
 * PU does not use cube-maps

In summary, the issues outlined above are solvable. :-)


== 2. Make PU a suitable base for Privateer: Wing Commander Universe

I think it is important to recognize and acknowledge that this goal is
more about "taste", which implies someone setting a standard for "good"
vs. "not good enough".

For now, this will likely be a meritocracy, where whoever does the work
gets to set the standard -- at least initially.

Personally, I support not deleting anything right away.

Observations:
 * PU is not well balanced currently
 * PU ships are not too pretty.
 * The extra campaign stuff needs a bit of TLC
 * The PU assets are not all working
 * The VS backgrounds don't really fit with the theme IMHO
 * Confed/Militia AI ships don't kill very many ships, which is odd.

Bug notes:
 * PU tarsus was too small -- increased scale from 1 to 12 (only affects new games?)
 ** Ok, 12 might be too large...
 * Upped default {game,gun}_speed from 0.1 to 0.2 (should be enough)
 * Difficulty seems wrong -- player can take too much punishment?
 * Ships are upgraded too aggressively -- fights become boring/protracted
 * Tarsus model is missing gun models?
 * Ships are parked in a weird position on the landing pad
 * Tarsus Mk2 uses a rather, er, unflattering texture
 * The map computer appears to not be scaled correctly to the VS map
 * Patrol mission description can offer more navpoints than are in the system
 ** The mission is scaled down correctly by the patrol mission script.
 * It's tedious to sell missiles -- create Buy/Sell 1, 5 and 10 buttons.

Changes worth making?
 * Tarsus Mk2 should be similar to the Tarsus in most respects except having upgraded armor
   and being able to fit a lvl 2 reactor and a belly turret. Let's pretend that its
   slight increase in armor is offset by smarter construction.

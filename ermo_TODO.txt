# Goals

The overarching goal is two-fold:

 1. Update PU to run on the newest VS on Linux

 2. Make PU a suitable base for Privateer: Wing Commander Universe


## 1. Update PU to run on the newest VS on Linux

Facts:
 * Sadly, it seems we've lost access to the PU SVN history.
 * PU r505 does not work on Linux due to case-sensitivity issues (FIXED)
 * The r505 PU assets are not all working, in that sprites reference
   missing assets (FIXED)
 * The Windows support stuff is outdated (the VS Windows support is
   fine, however)
 * PU used cube-maps in r505 as far as I can tell, so cubemaps vs.
   spheremaps is a non-issue.

In summary, the issues outlined above are solvable. :-)


## 2. Make PU a suitable base for Privateer: Wing Commander Universe

I think it is important to recognize and acknowledge that this goal is
more about "taste", which implies someone setting a standard for "good"
vs. "not good enough".

For now, this will likely be a meritocracy, where whoever does the work
gets to set the standard -- at least initially.

Personally, I support not deleting anything (extra campaign missions,
non-canon ship variants) right away.

### Observations:

 * PU is not super well balanced currently. Anything more than 2
   opposing ships can be a challenge due to funky ship upgrade
   decisions.
 * The extra PU campaign stuff needs a bit of TLC
 * The PU assets are not all working (mostly fixed as of now)
 * I prefer the GG space backgrounds over the VS space backgrounds.
 * Confed/Militia AI ships don't appear to be particularly effective at
   killing bad guys, which is odd
 * It would be nice to have the in-system map display which facilities
   are available on each station (ship dealer, guilds)
 * It would be nice to have the quadrant maps display the base names of
   each system
 * The map system needs 'fatter' assets -- the current wireframe
   assets are 1px wide, which is not enough.
 * Sometimes, systems become too brigt or too red -- why? Local issue?
 * Tarsus Mk2 uses a rather, er, unflattering texture
 ** Now that I've updated the vegastrike.config file, things do look better!
 * It would be cool to be able to plot a route even when not in the cockpit
 ** Which implies that one's personal system would have an uplink with the
    ship computer and one could plot mission routes sitting in the bar, for
    instance.
 ** The rationale is that the original game placed a burden on the player to
    keep tabs on stuff that one would expect to be able to do with a computer.
    Why not have support systems?
 * The lure of Privater for me is the voice acting, the music, the 'ambience'.
   And the art is of course something I remember fondly. But most of all, the
   space combat was fast and furious, giving you a sense of accomplishment.
 * There is no facility for deleting save games?
 * There are no messages about functions turning on/off (think turret ai)?
 * I wonder if the turret AI can be made to fire in bursts of n shots
   if ships are within a given distance? This is to give time to recharge.
 * If I buy a new part and regret my purchase and return it, why do I
   not get full price for it?  I would be ok with not getting full price
   for parts that I've lifted off with, but as long as I have not lifted off,
   I want the same price if I decide to return a part.
 * If adversary ships are upgraded too aggressively, fights become boring/protracted
 ** I've turned off upgrading for now and plan to revamp the ship
    upgrade logic ASAP
 * It's tedious to sell missiles -- create Buy/Sell 1, 5 and 10 buttons?

Bug notes:
 * Tarsus model is missing gun models?
 * Tarsus hud model does not show up at the ship dealer?
 * Why are there no shield indications on the hud when flying?!
 * Ships are often parked in a weird position on the landing pad
 * The map computer appears to not be scaled correctly to the VS map
 * Patrol mission description can offer more navpoints than are in the system
 ** The mission is scaled down correctly by the patrol mission script
    though
 * The mission computer does not display the name of the current planet(!)
   -- PO does and so does GG.
 * Wingmen fire all the time -- can I tell them to cease fire? Can they
   be taught to cease fire if no hostiles are nearby?
 ** This might be releated to the 'attack my target' command?
 * When the FerretCVL is selected on game start, the game loads. However,
   the fixer text displayed appears to change color (green becomes red,
   blue becomes violet)
 * New Detroit planet texture is a boring dark slate color -- naming
   issue?

Changes:
 * Default Tarsus size modified from 1 to 6 (was too small before)
 * Changed master_parts_list.csv to avoid mismatched categories for parts
   (seen with the starting Tarsus)
 ** Hull and Armor => Hull, Armor
 ** Sensors => Radar
 ** Shields => Shield Systems
 * Upped default {game,gun}_speed from 0.1 to 0.2 (should be enough)
 * Tarsus Mk2 should be similar to the Tarsus in most respects except having
   upgraded armor and being able to fit a lvl 2 reactor and a belly turret.
   Let's pretend that its slight increase in armor is offset by smarter
   construction (keeping mass and inertia the same as the original Tarsus,
   and thus keeping its handling)

= Goals

The overarching goal is two-fold:

 1. Update PU to run on the newest VS on Linux

 2. Make PU a suitable base for Privateer: Wing Commander Universe


== 1. Update PU to run on the newest VS on Linux

Facts:
 * Sadly, we've lost access to the PU SVN history.
 * PU r505 does not work on Linux due to case-sensitivity issues
 * The PU assets are not all working (sprites reference missing assets)
 * The Windows support stuff is outdated
 * PU does not use cube-maps (?)

In summary, the issues outlined above are solvable. :-)


== 2. Make PU a suitable base for Privateer: Wing Commander Universe

I think it is important to recognize and acknowledge that this goal is
more about "taste", which implies someone setting a standard for "good"
vs. "not good enough".

For now, this will likely be a meritocracy, where whoever does the work
gets to set the standard -- at least initially.

Personally, I support not deleting anything right away.

Observations:
 * PU is not super well balanced currently. Anything more
   than 2 opposing ships is a challenge.
 * The extra PU campaign stuff needs a bit of TLC
 * The PU assets are not all working
 * I prefer the GG space backgrounds over the VS space backgrounds.
 * Confed/Militia AI ships don't appear to be particularly effective at
   killing bad guys, which is odd.
 * It would be nice to have the in-system map display which facilities
   are available on each station (ship dealer, guilds)
 * It would be nice to have the quadrant maps display the base names of
   each system
 * The map system needs 'fatter' assets -- the current wireframe
   assets are 1px wide, which is not enough.
 * Sometimes, systems become too brigt or too red -- why? Local issue?
 * Tarsus Mk2 uses a rather, er, unflattering texture
 * It would be cool to be able to plot a route even when not in the cockpit
 ** which implies that one's personal system would have an uplink with the
    ship computer and one could plot mission routes sitting in the bar, for
    instance.
 ** The rationale is that the original game placed a burden on the player to
    keep tabs on stuff that one would expect to be able to do with a computer.
    Why not have support systems?
 * The lure of Privater for me is the voice acting, the  music, the 'ambience'.
   And the art is of course something I remember fondly. But most of all, the
   space combat was fast and furious, giving you a sense of accomplishment.
 * There is no facility for deleting save games?
 * There are no messages about functions turning on/off (think turret ai)?
 * I wonder if the turret AI can be made to fire in bursts of n shots
   if ships are within a given distance? This is to give time to recharge.
 * If I buy a new part and regret my purchase and return it, why do I
   not get full price for it?  I would be ok with not getting full price
   for parts that I've lifted off with, but as long as I have not lifted off,
   I want the same price if I decide to return a part.
 * If adversary ships are upgraded too aggressively, fights become boring/protracted
 * It's tedious to sell missiles -- create Buy/Sell 1, 5 and 10 buttons?
 * Ensure that Talons can only get up to Light upgrades
   (start w/L0, upgrade to max L1, either 3xLasers or 2xLasers + Mass Driver)
 * SparrowHawks could get up to L2 upgrades and get 2xLasers + 1xMeson

Bug notes:
 * Tarsus model is missing gun models?
 * Ships are parked in a weird position on the landing pad
 * The map computer appears to not be scaled correctly to the VS map
 * Patrol mission description can offer more navpoints than are in the system
 ** The mission is scaled down correctly by the patrol mission script.
 * The mission computer does not display the name of the current planet(!)
   -- PO does and so does GG.
 * Wingmen fire all the time -- can I tell to cease fire? Can they be told
   to cease fire if no hostiles are nearby?

Changes:
 * Default Tarsus size modified from 1 to 6 (was too small before)
 * Changed master_parts_list.csv to avoid mismatched categories for parts
   (seen with the starting Tarsus)
 ** Hull and Armor => Hull, Armor 
 ** Sensors => Radar
 ** Shields => Shield Systems
 * Upped default {game,gun}_speed from 0.1 to 0.2 (should be enough) 
 * Tarsus Mk2 should be similar to the Tarsus in most respects except having upgraded armor
   and being able to fit a lvl 2 reactor and a belly turret. Let's pretend that its
   slight increase in armor is offset by smarter construction
   (keeping mass and inertia the same as the original Tarsus, and thus keeping its handling)
